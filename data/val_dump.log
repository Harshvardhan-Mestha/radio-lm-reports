Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life​.

Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life​.

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a significant area of increased opacity in the lung fields, which could correspond to a region of consolidation. This diffuse radiopacity is indicative of pneumonia, which is an infection of the lung tissues leading to airspaces being filled with inflammatory cells and fluids. There is no apparent shift in the trachea or mediastinum, and the diaphragm appears to be in a normal position, which reduces the likelihood of atelectasis. The consolidation pattern seen here is more characteristic of pneumonia.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: Retrocardiac lung nodules (chest radiograph)
-Atelectasis
Patient Data:
Age - 65
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Cough and weight loss

Description: Multiple nodules are evident behind the heart in the left lower 
lobe, concerning for metastasis.  Additionally, there is linear atelectasis 
in the left lower zone.  The right lung is clear.  Normal heart and 
mediastinal contours.  

Inverted: Inverting the image can aid in interpretation and can make 
nodules more apparent.

Case Discussion: Behind the heart is one of the review areas which should 
be checked when interpretating chest radiographs. Pulmonary nodules have a 
wide differential diagnosis, and multiple rounded nodules should raise 
alarm for lung metastasis.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Pericardial calcification

Patient Data:
Age - 80
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Heart Failure

Description: A geographic box-shaped area of calcification is projected over the heart.

Pulmonary vascular markings are mildly prominent.

Healed fractures of the right 4th-8th ribs laterally.

Case Discussion: The patient underwent pericardiectomy in an attempt to 
improve cardiac function.

The cause for pericardial calcification remained unknown.
The patient had a distant history of abdominal tuberculosis. He also had a 
history of prior trauma with right-sided rib fractures - possible 
hemopericardium at the time? Both are potential causes.

There was no history of cardiac disease or cardiac surgery.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis

Patient Data:
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Withheld

Description: Massive bilateral conglomerate nodular calcifications 
appearing localized to the thoracic wall. There is no evidence of pulmonary 
fibrosis. Findings are long-term stable over 10 years.

Case Study: There is a broad differential diagnosis for intrathoracic 
calcifications. In order to narrow down the list, one must assess (1) the 
location (parenchymal, pleural-based, mediastinal or chest wall) and (2) if 
parenchymal, whether they are focal or diffuse. 

In this particular case, intraparenchymal parasitic etiology was initially 
considered based on the intrathoracic calcifications but over the years, 
the patient developed symmetrical soft tissue dystrophic calcifications in 
the bilateral upper and lower limbs. FDG-PET suggested active disease at 
the sites of calcinosis without signs of malignancy. The patient finally 
underwent a skin biopsy confirming dermatomyositis.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/91038
        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows multiple areas of increased opacity scattered throughout both lungs, which is a characteristic pattern seen in pneumonia. The diffuse nature of the opacities suggests a widespread infection rather than the localized volume loss seen in atelectasis. These consolidations likely represent areas filled with fluid or pus due to the inflammation caused by pneumonia, making this the most likely diagnosis. There is no evident shift of anatomical structures or significant volume loss that would indicate atelectasis.

Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life​.

Patient Data:
Age - 80
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Heart Failure

Description: A geographic box-shaped area of calcification is projected over the heart.

Pulmonary vascular markings are mildly prominent.

Healed fractures of the right 4th-8th ribs laterally.

Case Discussion: The patient underwent pericardiectomy in an attempt to 
improve cardiac function.

The cause for pericardial calcification remained unknown.
The patient had a distant history of abdominal tuberculosis. He also had a 
history of prior trauma with right-sided rib fractures - possible 
hemopericardium at the time? Both are potential causes.

There was no history of cardiac disease or cardiac surgery.

Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life​.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis

Patient Data:
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Withheld

Description: Massive bilateral conglomerate nodular calcifications 
appearing localized to the thoracic wall. There is no evidence of pulmonary 
fibrosis. Findings are long-term stable over 10 years.

Case Study: There is a broad differential diagnosis for intrathoracic 
calcifications. In order to narrow down the list, one must assess (1) the 
location (parenchymal, pleural-based, mediastinal or chest wall) and (2) if 
parenchymal, whether they are focal or diffuse. 

In this particular case, intraparenchymal parasitic etiology was initially 
considered based on the intrathoracic calcifications but over the years, 
the patient developed symmetrical soft tissue dystrophic calcifications in 
the bilateral upper and lower limbs. FDG-PET suggested active disease at 
the sites of calcinosis without signs of malignancy. The patient finally 
underwent a skin biopsy confirming dermatomyositis.

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows diffuse patchy opacities throughout both lung fields, which are characteristic findings in pneumonia. These areas of increased opacity indicate the presence of consolidation or infiltrates caused by infection, which are hallmark features of pneumonia. Unlike atelectasis, which generally causes a shift in anatomical structures due to lung volume loss, these patches of opacities are more scattered and do not indicate a significant shift or elevation of the diaphragm. The distribution and appearance of these infiltrates support the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life​.

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows an area of increased opacity in the left lung field, which suggests a loss of lung volume typical of atelectasis. The density of the area appears consolidated, and there is a visible shift in anatomical structures, such as the mediastinum, which is a hallmark sign of lung collapse or partial collapse. These observations collectively point towards atelectasis as the most likely diagnosis.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: Retrocardiac lung nodules (chest radiograph)
-Atelectasis
Patient Data:
Age - 65
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Cough and weight loss

Description: Multiple nodules are evident behind the heart in the left lower 
lobe, concerning for metastasis.  Additionally, there is linear atelectasis 
in the left lower zone.  The right lung is clear.  Normal heart and 
mediastinal contours.  

Inverted: Inverting the image can aid in interpretation and can make 
nodules more apparent.

Case Discussion: Behind the heart is one of the review areas which should 
be checked when interpretating chest radiographs. Pulmonary nodules have a 
wide differential diagnosis, and multiple rounded nodules should raise 
alarm for lung metastasis.

Patient Presentation: Chronic cough and left-sided chest pain for a long time.

Description: Left lower hemithorax dense irregular linear calcifications 
deep to the left lateral rib cage associated with tenting of the left

Lungs are clear.

Case Discussion: The presence of a solitary, evident unilateral sheet of 
pleural calcification points more to local causes such as previous

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a diffused increase in opacity in the lower right lung field, which is indicative of pneumonia. The absence of significant anatomical shifts, such as mediastinal deviations or elevated hemidiaphragms, reduces the likelihood of atelectasis. Instead, the pattern of increased opacity is more consistent with a consolidation or infection typical of pneumonia. The presence of these signs suggests a localized infection or inflammation in the lung tissue, characteristic of pneumonia.

These observations collectively indicate that the lung or a part of it has collapsed or is not fully inflated, which is indicative of atelectasis.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a noticeable increase in opacity in the left upper lung region, indicating a loss of lung volume. The trachea and mediastinal structures are deviating towards the left, which is a typical sign of atelectasis as the lung collapses and pulls the surrounding structures with it. The left hemidiaphragm appears to be elevated, which further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis. These findings suggest that part of the lung on the left side is collapsed or not fully inflated.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a loss of volume in the lung, indicated by areas of increased opacity and a shifting of anatomical structures. The visible increased density and the apparent abnormal positioning of the lung structures are consistent with lung collapse. These signs are hallmark indicators of atelectasis, suggesting that part of the lung may be collapsed or not fully inflated.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a distinct increase in opacity in the right lower lung region, which suggests a loss of lung volume in that area. Additionally, there is an evident shift in the trachea towards the right side, indicating a mediastinal shift that is a classic sign of atelectasis. The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated, further supporting the diagnosis of atelectasis. These findings collectively suggest that part of the lung on the right side is collapsed or not fully inflated.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a noticeable increase in opacity in the lung region, indicating a loss of lung volume. There is also an apparent shift in anatomical structures, such as the trachea and mediastinum, towards the area of increased opacity. These signs suggest a collapse of the lung or part of it. The evident elevation of the diaphragm further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis, as these are hallmark indicators of the condition. These findings collectively suggest that part of the lung is collapsed or not fully inflated.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows increased opacity in a specific area of the lung, suggesting a loss of lung volume in that region. Furthermore, the anatomical structures, such as the trachea and mediastinum, appear to have shifted, which is a common indicator of atelectasis. The presence of these signs suggests that part of the lung has collapsed or is not fully inflated. The consistent increase in density and abnormal positioning of the lung structures support the diagnosis of atelectasis.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a significant increase in opacity in the right lung field, which suggests a loss of lung volume in that region. Additionally, there is an evident shift of the mediastinal structures towards the right side, indicating a mediastinal shift. The right hemidiaphragm also appears elevated, which are classic signs of atelectasis. These observations collectively indicate that the lung or a part of it has collapsed or is not fully inflated, which is indicative of atelectasis.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows several features indicative of atelectasis. There is a noticeable increase in opacity, especially in the central region of the chest, which suggests a loss of lung volume. Furthermore, the visible shift in the anatomical structures, such as the mediastinum towards the side of increased opacity, is a common sign of atelectasis. These observations collectively point towards the collapse or incomplete inflation of a part of the lung.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows an area of increased opacity in the region of the lung, which suggests a loss of lung volume typical of atelectasis. The density of the area appears consolidated, and there is a visible shift in anatomical structures, such as the trachea and mediastinum, which are hallmark signs of lung collapse or partial collapse. The right hemidiaphragm seems elevated, further supporting a loss of volume in the lung. These observations collectively point towards atelectasis as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n            '}

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Dermatomyositis

Patient Data:
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Withheld

Description: Massive bilateral conglomerate nodular calcifications 
appearing localized to the thoracic wall. There is no evidence of pulmonary 
fibrosis. Findings are long-term stable over 10 years.

Case Study: There is a broad differential diagnosis for intrathoracic 
calcifications. In order to narrow down the list, one must assess (1) the 
location (parenchymal, pleural-based, mediastinal or chest wall) and (2) if 
parenchymal, whether they are focal or diffuse. 

In this particular case, intraparenchymal parasitic etiology was initially 
considered based on the intrathoracic calcifications but over the years, 
the patient developed symmetrical soft tissue dystrophic calcifications in 
the bilateral upper and lower limbs. FDG-PET suggested active disease at 
the sites of calcinosis without signs of malignancy. The patient finally 
underwent a skin biopsy confirming dermatomyositis.

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows multiple areas of increased opacity within both lungs, which is characteristic of infiltrates commonly seen in pneumonia. These areas of consolidation suggest an infection that has spread through the lung tissue. Unlike atelectasis, which typically presents with loss of lung volume and associated anatomical shifts, there is no significant evidence of a mediastinal shift or elevated diaphragm in this image. The diffuse infiltration pattern is consistent with the presence of an infectious process, thereby supporting the diagnosis of pneumonia.
