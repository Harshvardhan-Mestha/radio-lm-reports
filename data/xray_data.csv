Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Left chest pain, 1 week post splenectomy

Description: Bilateral symmetrical curvilinear opacities extending 
superolaterally from the lower mediastinum. They are separate from the 
oblique fissure on the lateral projection, most likely to be atelectasis.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is common after large surgical procedures, 
patients will often present with chest pain native to the side of collapse. 
Subsegmental atelectasis like this is often best visualized on computed 
tomography.

Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Post thoracostomy for stab wound.

Description: Satisfactory position of the ETT and left chest drain.

Small volume left lung. Increased left lower zone attenuation due to left 
lower lobe atelectasis which obscures the descending aorta and left 
hemidiaphragm. The area contains an air-filled bronchus, the diaphragm is 
elevated and the heart is shifted to the left.

Patient Data: 
Age - 80
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Chronic Cough

Description: Pulmonary hyperinflation, right middle lobe atelectasis. 
No edema, pneumonia or pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is the term used to describe deflated lung. 
There are multiple different causes of atelectasis but in the absence of 
endobronchial obstruction, surfactant deficiency, pneumothorax, or an 
adjacent space-occupying lesion compressing the lung, the most likely cause 
is scarring. Atelectasis due to scarring is called cicatricial or 
cicatrisation atelectasis and is often due to prior infection, especially 
mycobacterial.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Lung cancer causing complete atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough and SOB

Description: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with 
findings of volume loss such as shift of the mediastinum to the left and 
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating that the left lung is 
atelectatic. There is abrupt ""cut off"" of the left main bronchus, 
suggesting that the bronchus is obstructed.

Case Discussion: The two most common reasons for complete opacification of a 
hemithorax are complete atelectasis of a lung and a massive pleural effusion. 
This case illustrates characteristic features of ""white out"" due to 
atelectasis, in this case due to lung cancer obstructing the left main 
bronchus. Mediastinal shift toward the atelectatic lung and elevation of 
the diaphragm are especially well seen on the coronal images.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Right main bronchus intubation causing left lung atelectasis
-Air bronochograms

Patient Data:
Age - 45
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Bradycardia and hypotension following induction of 
anesthesia. Increasing airway pressures and progressive hypoxemia. 
Cardiac arrest.

Description: The ETT extends beyond the carina into the right main bronchus. 
There is near-complete consolidation of the left lung with air bronchograms 
present, representing resorptive atelectasis in this clinical context. No 
significant mediastinal shift. Other possible causes for this appearance 
can include, for example, pneumonia, pulmonary edema and pulmonary 
hemorrhage.

Right internal jugular CVL is appropriately positioned.

Follow up: Following retraction of the ETT, there has been significant 
re-aeration of the left lung. Persistent dense consolidation remains within 
the left lower lobe. The right lung remains well expanded with no focal 
consolidation.

Case Discussion: This case represents a classic example of right main 
bronchus intubation. The patient was intubated as part of induction of 
anesthesia for an elective surgical procedure. Unfortunately, high airway 
pressures were observed following intubation with the rapid development of 
bradycardia, hypotension and hypoxemia with subsequent cardiac arrest. 
Following a short period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of 
spontaneous circulation occurred. This radiograph was taken immediately on 
admission to ICU. The etiology of this event may be secondary to the drugs 
used during induction or as a result of excessive stimulation of vagal tone 
with direct laryngoscopy, which has been reported in case studies

Diagnosis: Right upper lobe atelectasis - intubated neonate

Patient Data:
Age - 22 days
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Increase work of breathing in mechanical ventilation

Description: Right upper lobe opacification with volume loss in keeping 
with right upper lobe atelectasis.

ET tube tip is just above carina.

Left upper limb PICC tip over right atrium.

NG tube tip in stomach.

After ETT: ET tube tip has been withdrawn compared to previous.

Resolution of right upper lobe atelectasis.

Bronchovascular prominence persists.

Case Discussion : Right upper lobe collapse is not uncommon in neonates who 
have been intubated. The position of the tube on the x-ray is not always 
the position of the tube during intubation and so, a tube tip that is a 
little low on the film may have been in the right main bronchus distal to 
the RUL bronchus during the procedure resulting in RUL collapse.

Similar findings can be seen in neonates with infection although the right 
upper lobe would be an unusual location.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Left lung atelectasis caused by right main bronchus intubation

Patient Data: 
Age - 40
Gender -Female

Patient Presentation: In ICU after an MVA sustained a few days earlier. 
Reduced oxygenation.

Description: The ETT tip arches into the right main bronchus. As a 
consequence the transparency of the left hemithorax is markedly reduced, 
due to resultant atelectasis. For a supine CXR like this pleural effusion 
is an important differential diagnosis. The marked shift of the mediastinum 
to the left confirms that air space collapse is the main contributor to the 
reduced transparency. 
Other findings:

Diffuse bilateral air space opacities represent prior lung contusion
Multiple rib fractures (right), bilateral clavicle and right scapular 
fracture.
Right subclavian CVC in a normal position.

Case Discussion: Typical presentation of endobronchial intubation and its

Diagnosis: Right main bronchial intubation
-Atelectasis

Patient Data:
Age - 60
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Recent endotracheal tube placement 

Description: Initial chest x-ray shows an endotracheal tube in the right 
main bronchus/bronchus intermedius with complete opacification left 
hemithorax and shift of the mediastinum to the left indicating complete 
atelectasis left lung.

After retraction: Subsequent chest x-ray after retraction of the 
endotracheal tube shows tube tip appropriately positioned above the carina 
and partial reexpansion left lung. Both studies show a nasogastric tube 
coiled in the pharynx/proximal esophagus. 

Case Discussion: The tip of an endotracheal tube should be positioned above 
the carina. If positioned too far distally, the tip most often ends up in 
the right bronchus because the right bronchus has a more direct origin from 
the trachea than the left bronchus. Tube placement into the right bronchus 
often results in atelectasis of the left lung which can be ""cured"" by 
retracting the tube proximal to the carina.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: Right lung atelactasis due to endobronchial cancer


Patient Data: 
Age - 60 
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough

Description: Complete opacification of the right hemithorax with tracheal 
shift to the right, indicating complete atelectasis within the right lung. 
The left main bronchus is normally aerated, while the right bronchus is 
invisible and likely filled with soft tissue. Soft tissue projects into the 
distal trachea at the level of the carina. The left lung is hyperinflated.

Case Discussion: The 2 most common causes of hemithorax opacification 
(white-out) are complete atelectasis of a lung and a massive pleural 
effusion, but they can often be easily distinguished. Remember that the 
lung is basically a balloon: normally inflated air-filled lung has normal 
volume and is black, but deflated (atelectatic) lung has low volume and is 
opaque (white, soft tissue density). Volume loss results in shift of the 
mediastinum (heart and trachea) to the side of the white-out. When a 
massive effusion (usually due to pleural metastases) causes white-out, 
the additional ""stuff"" pushes the mediastinum away from the opacified 
hemithorax. In our case, there is shift of the heart and trachea to the 
side of the white-out in this patient with lung cancer obstructing the 
right main bronchus resulting in right lung atelectasis.

hyperexpansion - this is subtle.

Case Discussion: Lobar collapse refers to collapse of an entire lobe of the 
lung. As such it is a subtype of atelectasis, which is a more generic term 
for 'incomplete expansion'. Individual lobes of the lung may collapse due 
to obstruction of the supplying bronchus.

hydropneumothorax

visceral pleural thickening (pleural encasement)

lobar atelectasis

These features persist despite the placement of a pleural drain.

These cases are often treated with wide-bore surgical drains. Most slowly 
resolve over time, however some cases require surgical intervention with 
pleurectomy and decortication. In this instance, a PleurX drain was placed

Patient Presentation: Chronic left pleural effusion. Post thoracocentesis.

Description: Left basal pneumothorax with air-fluid level and mensiscus 
indicating that this is actually a hydropneumothorax. Left chest wall 
subcutaneous emphysema. Left upper and lower lobe atelectasis. Right upper 
lobe granuloma. 

Case Discussion: Most pneumothoraces post ultrasounded-guided thoracentesis 
(which are uncommon in themselves) result from unavoidable stress-related 
parenchymal-pleural fistulas that result from trapped (unexpandable) lung 
rather than being procedure related (e.g. direct lung puncture, poor 
technique). 

Radiographic signs of trapped lung include:

visceral pleural peel (thickening)
basilar pneumothorax
ipsilateral volume loss
lobar atelectasis

Patient Presentation: Chest pain post chest tube removal.

Description:  Large right-sided pneumothorax with complete collapse of the

2. Minimal left lower lung zone atelectasis. No discrete focal 
consolidation, effusion or pneumothorax on the left.

3. The heart and central pulmonary vascularity appear normal.

4. No acute osseous findings. No free air in the upper abdomen.

Case Discussion: Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space 
accompanied with collapse or atelectasis of the lung. The collection of air 
may compress the mediastinal structures and result in tension pneumothorax 
which is a true emergency requiring urgent needle thoracostomy or chest 
tube placement. With no tension present it is referred to as simple 
pneumothorax. Causes of pneumothorax varies and can be categorized into 
primary, secondary, and iatrogenic or traumatic.

Chest x-ray evaluation for recurrent tuberculosis.

Description: No new focal pneumonia, effusion or pneumothorax. Mild diffuse

Stable right upper lobe scarring with adjacent pleural thickening/reaction 
consistent with history of tuberculosis. No evidence of active TB.

The heart remains normal sized without pulmonary vascular congestion.

Almost diffuse curvilinear/circumferential pericardial calcification.

No acute osseous findings.

Case Discussion: Tuberculous pericarditis is frequently reported as the 
primary cause of pericardial calcification 1 and occurs in approximately 1 
to 2 percent of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This is a rare 
finding in the Western World. However, tuberculous pericarditis accounts 
for nearly 10% of chronic constrictive pericarditis cases in the United 
States 2. There is strong evidence that large calcific pericardial deposits 
indicate “burnt-out” pericardial tuberculosis 2. Detecting the pericardial 
calcification on radiography is important for definitive diagnosis 2.

Case Discussion:On the chest x-ray, there is mitral annular calcification. 
His cardiac chest pain was treated appropriately and a 12 hour Troponin 
confirmed that he had suffered some myocardial necrosis.

A subsequent echocardiogram confirmed significant mitral stenosis and 
angiography confirmed significant 3 vessel disease.

He was transferred to the local cardiac unit for three vessel CABG and 
mitral valve replacement. His post surgical recovery was uneventful.

Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Intravenous drug user with end-stage renal failure on 
long term peritoneal dialysis. She was non-compliant with her peritoneal 
dialysis and had poor calcium phosphate control. She presented with digital 
ischemia involving her right hand and both feet.

Description: Widespread calcified infiltrates throughout both lung fields. 
Right-sided intercostal catheter in situ due to recent lung biopsy. Also of 
note is the diffuse calcification of both brachial arteries.

Case Discussion: Progress: 
The patient's condition deteriorated and she died soon after this imaging 
was obtained. An autopsy was performed.

Autopsy findings: 
Evidence of calciphylaxis involving the peripheral arm vessels, aorta, 
splenic artery, proximal renal arteries and pumonary vessels. The right 
radial artery was completely thrombosed and there was distal digital 
ischemia. 

Further changes included wide spread pulmonary metastatic calcification.  

Renal changes were end stage.  She also had a splenic infarct and acute 
bronchopeunomia, with the latter being the presumed cause of death.

Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Routine pre-operative chest radiograph prior to 
surgery for urethral stenosis. 50 year smoking history.

Description: Frontal:

Ill-defined bilateral hila with multiple calcified adenopathies in it and 
in the retrocardiac space. Right costophrenic angle blunting. Aortic arch 
elongated and calcified.

Lateral:

We can easily appreciate the ""eggshell"" calcification of multiple

Case Discussion: Main causes of lymph node calcification:

benign
tuberculosis
histoplasmosis
sarcoidosis
silicosis
coal worker's pneumoconiosis
amyloidosis
malignant
​treated lymphoma and metastases
Aids to differentiating cause: silicosis vs sarcoidosis vs tuberculosis

calcified lymph nodes in tuberculosis tend to affect the mediastinum 
asymmetrically and unilaterally
diffuse bilateral lymph node involvement is more common in sarcoidosis
silicosis: the patient usually has a history of a silica-exposure related 
job (as in this case)"

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Calcification of mitral valve and left ventricle

Patient Data:
Age - 75
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: History of mitral valve regurgitation status post 
mechanical valve replacement.

Description: Extensive and dense calcifications in the region of the mitral 
valve and left ventricle. A mitral valve prosthesis is in the appropriate 
position. 

No discrete focal pneumonia, effusion, or pneumothorax.

Mild bilateral bronchial wall thickening is likely a chronic finding.

The heart appears at upper limits normal without pulmonary vascular 
congestion.

Intact and broken sternotomy sutures are seen in place. The upper abdomen 
appears normal.

Case discussion: The etiology of mitral valve and annular calcification is 
multifactorial with the most common contribution from chronic disease 
conditions associated with coronary artery disease. Mitral annular 
calcifications are commonly associated with mitral valve regurgitation and 
mostly remain asymptomatic. However, if associated with mitral valvular 
dysfunction like in this case the condition might require subsequent mitral 
valve replacement.

Case Discussion: Physiological tracheal and bronchial cartilage 
calcification is asymptomatic and typically affects women over 40, 
progressing with age.

Generalized calcification of airway cartilage can also be seen in end-stage 
renal disease, also in adults and children taking warfarin which inhibits 
vitamin K-dependent proteins. Vitamin K normally prevents calcification of

Patient Data:
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Withheld

Description: Massive bilateral conglomerate nodular calcifications 
appearing localized to the thoracic wall. There is no evidence of pulmonary 
fibrosis. Findings are long-term stable over 10 years.

Case Study: There is a broad differential diagnosis for intrathoracic 
calcifications. In order to narrow down the list, one must assess (1) the 
location (parenchymal, pleural-based, mediastinal or chest wall) and (2) if 
parenchymal, whether they are focal or diffuse. 

In this particular case, intraparenchymal parasitic etiology was initially 
considered based on the intrathoracic calcifications but over the years, 
the patient developed symmetrical soft tissue dystrophic calcifications in 
the bilateral upper and lower limbs. FDG-PET suggested active disease at 
the sites of calcinosis without signs of malignancy. The patient finally 
underwent a skin biopsy confirming dermatomyositis.

enlarged.

Patchy opacities at both lung fields.

Case Discussion: This patient present with cardiomegaly and large bilateral 
pulmonary arteries on chest radiograph. It was further investigated for 
pulmonary embolism, in which CTPA was performed. CTPA shows poor contrast 
opacification of pulmonary vessels (likely due to mixture of contrasted and 
non-contrasted blood). There is also suspicious communication at aorta and 
pulmonary arteries. CTA thoracic aorta was performed which confirm the 
presence of patent ductus arteriosus. The contrast from the aorta clearly 
flow into the pulmonary artery system, in which opacifies the pulmonary 
arteries.

The arterial circulation is still higher pressure compared to pulmonary 
arterial circulation in this case. Eisenmenger phenomenon still did not 
occur in this patient (which pulmonary artery circulation is higher 
pressure compared to arterial circulation).

Description: 1. Initial XR chest evaluation demonstrates moderately severe 
cardiomegaly with mild to moderate diffuse pulmonary vascular congestion 
and mild to moderate pulmonary interstitial edema.

2. ​There is slight asymmetric increased opacification of the left lung 
field likely due to dependent edema. ​

3.  No definite effusion or pneumothorax. No osseous anomaly.

1. ETT terminates at T1 level. OG tube courses into the stomach. 
UVC is seen terminating in the low right atrium.

2. Mild improved bilateral lung aeration. Now noted is increased diffuse 
haziness mainly in the left upper and midzone, most likely due to 
asymmetric pulmonary edema.

3. Stable moderately severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary interstitial edema.

4. No definite effusion or pneumothorax. No osseous anomaly.

Case Discussion: Full-term infant of a diabetic mother born via C-section with 
respiratory distress and a systolic murmur. Initial chest x-ray demonstrated 
moderately-severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion and 
interstitial edema. An echocardiogram was performed which confirmed marked 
biventricular hypertrophy in addition to other cardiac findings including 
hypertrophied interventricular septum (thickness measuring 9 mm), dilated 
coronary arteries and narrowed aortic isthmus.  

Infants of diabetic mothers are at increased risk for cardiac valvular and 
septal lesions in addition to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In a large 
retrospective study, the prevalence of cardiovascular malformations in 
infants of diabetic mothers approached 4%, compared to less than 1% in 
babies with non-diabetic mothers 1.

The incidence of symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is reported to be 
as high as 12.1% of infants with diabetic mothers 2. Other associated 
findings include left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and reduced 
stroke volume 4. Septal enlargement and hypertrophy are secondary to fetal 
hyperinsulinemia.

Case Discussion: Cardiac silhouette enlargement can be simply a result of 
supine AP projection. However, in this case the cardiac silhouette is 
massively enlarged, most commonly from cardiomegaly, however, a pericardial 
effusion was echographically diagnosed. Note the pericardial drainage 
catheter on the x-ray, which seems to drain insufficiently. The patient is 
at high risk for cardiac tamponade.

-Small bi-basal pleural effusions
Patient Data:
Age - 25 
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Emergency admission with pleuritic chest pain, 
shortness of breath, cough and leg swelling. Generally unwell over two weeks, 
with significant weight loss over a few months. No known medical history. 
Non-smoker. Vacation within the last month with three hour flight. No 
medications. New fast AF (215 bpm).

Description: Allowing for AP projection, marked cardiomegaly. Prominance of 
central pulmonary vessels. Small bi-basal pleural effusions.

Case Discussion: This patient presented with chest pain and breathlessness 
on a background of weight loss and lethargy. Further history revealed a 
sub-acute history of heat intolerance and fine tremor. There was a family 
history of over-active thyroid.

The main finding in this patient's blood tests was abnormal thyroid 
function: free T4 (45), elevated free T3 and thyroid receptor antibodies and 
fully suppressed TSH.

This biochemical and clinical scenario was consistent with thyroid storm.

There were a number of management steps this patient required in the 
emergency setting:

control of heart rate: the patient was in uncontrolled AF and was loaded 
with digoxin and given thiazide diuretics and propranolol

echocardiogram: severe left ventricular dysfunction, moderate mitral 
regurgitation, ejection fraction 10%

treatment of hyperthyroid state: commenced on propylthiouricil and 
steroids

When the heart rate was better controlled, a repeat echo confirmed the 
above findings and the patient underwent DC cardioversion to good effect.

Patient Presentation: Known Down syndrome and complete AV septal defect 
verified by echocardiography. Fever, reduced blood oxygen saturation, 
tachy-dyspnea.

Description: Marked cardiomegaly as a consequence of the complete AV septal 
defect. 

Bilateral irregular, partially confluous, diffuse haziness showing a 
perihilar and right-sided predominance.

Partial effacement of the diaphragm contours. 

Presence of air bronchograms. 

Case Discussion: The observed marked cardiomegaly and perihilar (bat wing) 
opacities are in line with cardiogenic lung edema, as a sequela of the 
complete AV septal defect.

Considering the clinical picture the more confluous areas of consolidations 
also raise the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.

Diagnosis: Severe COPD and pectus excavatum

Patient Data:
Age - 45
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increasing shortness of breath. On home oxygen.

Description: The lungs are hyperexpanded. Obscuration of the right heart 
border. Prominent main pulmonary trunk, suggestive of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.

Case Discussion: Lung hyperinflation or hyperexpansion can be normal, 
especially in young patients who take a large breath in for an inspiratory 
chest radiograph or can reflect COPD. The latter is the cause in this case 
due to a history of heavy smoking and a clinical diagnosis. 

Pectus excavatum is a great mimicker of right middle lobe collapse or 
consolidation. The shift of the heart to the left and horizontally oriented 
ribs are good clues, and a lateral projection will confirm the diagnosis.

Patient Presentation: History of over 100 pack-years of cigarette smoking 
presents with symptoms of an acute COPD exacerbation.

Description: Enlarged right heart, flattened diaphragms, perihilar fullness, 
and diffuse interstitial opacification. Peripheral vascular markings are 
within normal limits.

Case Discussion: Most cases of COPD are caused by cigarette smoking. However, some 
cases are secondary to air pollution as seen in patients with occupational 
exposure to dust and fumes. A COPD exacerbation is most commonly caused by 
viruses. Viral etiology potentially explains why this patient has perihilar 
fullness and diffuse interstitial opacification.

Diagnosis: Chronic obstructive airways disease - increased lung volume

Patient Data: 
Age - 75
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Smoker, cough, respiratory distress.

Description:In the frontal projection there is an increased pulmonary volume, 
evidenced by lung hyper expansion, more than 9 posterior costal spaces and 
flattened diaphragms (see third image), this distance should be more than 1,5 
cm.

In the lateral projection there is an increased retrosternal space diameter, 
normally les than 2,5 cms.

Case Discussion: This is a typical appearance of increased lung volume with 
increased retro-sternal space (more than 2,5 cm), diaphragm flattening 
(less than 1.5 cm perpendicular distance to the inter recess line) and 
increased number of exposed intercostal spaces. The diagnosis of COPD 
relies on clinical assessment and detection of fixed airway obstruction by

Patient Presentation: Known HIV-positive patient with COPD. Ongoing 
anti-retroviral therapy and tuberculosis treatment. Presents with 
hemoptysis and septicemia.

Description: Hyperinflated lung fields are consistent with a known history 
of COPD. The trachea is central, with a tracheostomy in situ. The 
cardiomediastinal contour is normal.

There is a large, elliptiform, mass-like left hemithoracic opacity with 
sharp borders. There is no cavitation, no associated air-fluid level, no 
calcification, and no overlying rib erosion.

There is apical bronchovascular distortion consistent with previous 
pulmonary tuberculosis. There are bibasal effusions.

There is a left subclavian access CVP with overlying ECG leads.

The lateral view is absent, in keeping with a portable and intensive care 
setting.

Day 10 : Follow-up X-rays on day 10 demonstrate a progression of parenchymal 
changes and a static appearance of the left pseudotumor. There is some 
resolution of the basal effusions.

Day 17:On day 17, there are resolving parenchymal infective changes, 
improving left pseudotumor, and resolving bibasal pleural effusions.

Day 25: On day 25, the left encysted fluid has significantly resorbed, and 
the pleural pseudotumor appears much smaller. The bibasal pleural 
effusions have totally resolved with a sharper diaphragmatic contour and 
normal cardiophrenic and costophrenic recesses. Residual chronic 
parenchymal changes in a setting of known COPD.

Case Discussion: A case of a large, left pleural pseudotumor due to left 
oblique fissural encysted pleural fluid with bibasal pleural effusions. 
The pleural pseudotumor progressively resorbed over a lengthy ICU stay and 
improved without any percutaneous or surgical drainage.

There is known COPD, with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis on ongoing 
treatment. The patient is HIV-positive and on highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART).

Case Discussion: Cor pulmonale is defined as an alteration in the structure 
and function of the right ventricle (RV) of the heart caused by a primary 
disorder of the respiratory system such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Pulmonary embolic 
disease is often included in this classification and also causes pulmonary 
hypertension.

Echocardiographic evaluation is an important tool in the diagnosis and the 
prognostic stratification of patients with cor pulmonale.

Diagnosis: Malpositioned Angelchik Antireflux Prosthesis
-COPD

Patient Data:
Age - 90
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Nursing home patient with worsening cough and dyspnea

Description: Doughnut-shaped surgical device (Angelchik prosthesis) visible 
on CXR as well. The prosthesis is rotated vertically, rather than laying 
horizontally under the diaphragm.

Case Discussion: As per Burhenne et al1, the Angelchik Antireflux device was 
a commonly used simpler surgical alternative to gastropexy and 
fundoplication in the 1980s. It is a doughnut shaped prosthesis made of 
silicone with a radio-opaque outer margin. Post-operatively, it should sit 
sub-diaphragmatically around the abdominal part of the esophagus. Ideally, 
above the hepatic branch of the anterior vagus nerve.1  Unfortunately, 
dislodgment of the device into the chest or abdominal cavity over time has 
been reported1-3 and many patients have required removal of these devices 
as a result. By 1990 the use of the Angelchik prosthesis was uncommon as 
the Open Nissen's fundoplication became the accepted technique for the 
treatment of GERD, followed by laparoscopic surgery.

On first inspection of these images, a gastric lap band device had been a 
differential. However, the patient was known to have had an Angelchik 
procedure done over 20 years ago.

Although the Angelchik prosthesis is mispositioned in this patient, it is 
likely an incidental finding. The likely cause for the patient's symptoms 
are likely related to an exacerbation of his COPD and heart failure.

Case Discussion : This is an interesting learning case on several levels 
with some important radiological life lessons.

With COPD patients often the whole patient cannot be imaged on one 
radiograph. When one has to piece up the 2 pieces this can be more 
challenging to interpret.
The most useful thing for any radiologist is old imaging studies. Not 
looking for them or at them at your peril.
Satisfaction of search - don't be happy with spotting one abnormality. Look 
for more and it may take you further down the diagnostic pathway.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung

Case Discussion: Gestational choriocarcinoma is a type of malignant 
gestational trophoblastic disease which commonly arise after fertilization 
and implantation of the egg. Most cases of gestational choriocarcinoma are 
preceded by hydatidiform mole, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or normal 
pregnancy. However, non-gestational choriocarcinoma arises from pluripotent 
germ cells. Choriocarcinoma is characterized by the malignant transformation 
of the cytotrophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic tissue that grows into 
the myometrium without a chorionic villi. Choriocarcinoma commonly 
metastasizes early to the lungs, vagina, brain, and liver with a risk of 
hemorrhage due to its hypervascularity.

be sure to check there is only one nodule

ensure there are no other clues, such as an AP window node

Description: Multiple nodules are evident behind the heart in the left lower 
lobe, concerning for metastasis.  Additionally, there is linear atelectasis 
in the left lower zone.  The right lung is clear.  Normal heart and 
mediastinal contours.  

Inverted: Inverting the image can aid in interpretation and can make 
nodules more apparent.

Case Discussion: Behind the heart is one of the review areas which should 
be checked when interpretating chest radiographs. Pulmonary nodules have a 
wide differential diagnosis, and multiple rounded nodules should raise 
alarm for lung metastasis.

Diagnosis Certian
Diagnosis: Lung metastases

Patient data:
Age - 65

Patient Presentation: Previous head and neck malignancy. Night sweats 
and dyspnea.

Description: Multiple lung nodules and masses in both lungs of variable size. 
 No internal cavitation.

Normal mediastinal contours.

Heart size normal.

Surgical clips in the left axilla.

Case Discussion: Multiple nodules in both lungs of variable size with a 
prior history of malignancy are virtually always metastases.

Remember a lung nodule is termed a mass when 3 cm or greater.

Head and neck malignancies are typically squamous cell carcinomas and often 
cavitate when metastatic, although not in this case.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Nodular pulmonary amyloidosis

Patient Data:
Age - 73
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Incidental pulmonary nodules discovered on chest 
radiograph. The patient is asymptomatic.

Description: Multiple differently sized pulmonary nodules, some of which 
are calcified as seen on the dual-energy subtraction radiograph.

7 Years: Numerous calcified pulmonary nodules are increased from 7 years 
prior.  Interval radiographs (not shown) show slow progression in size, 
number, and degree of calcification of the nodules.

Case Discussion: This is a pathologically proven case. Biopsy of one of the 
lung nodules revealed amyloidosis.  The slow progression over seven years 
also is consistent with the diagnosis.

Differential diagnoses of calcifying metastases, granulomatous disease, or 
inhalational lung disease are not consistent with the findings and slow 
progression.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Tularemia

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Fever and cough. Recent trip to the zoo.

Description: AP chest radiograph shows a small right basal lung nodule and 
right hilar lymph node enlargement.

Case Discussion: Diagnosis is made by serological detection of antibodies by 
ELISA, PCR, or indirect fluorescent antibody testing of suppurative material. 
Warn laboratory staff as handling precautions are necessary.

Tularemia is a rare zoonosis caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. 
Skin, eyes, lymph nodes, and lungs are most commonly affected.

The chest imaging findings are variable but lymphadenopathy is the most 
common. Lung nodules, masses, and consolidation can also be present.

The primary differential diagnosis, in this case, is histoplasmosis. A 
detailed history of exposure, especially to wild animals, can help consider 
tularemia. Her only known exposure to animals was a recent trip to a zoo 
(unlikely to be the source in the author's opinion). Tularemia is considered 
a reportable disease in many jurisdictions.

Patient Presenation: Increasing breathlesness over many months

Description: The radiograph shows a coarse predominantly  reticular 
infiltrate in both upper lobes. There is associated significant volume loss 
on both sides.

No definite mediastinal or hilar abnormality is present. Heart size and 
shape is normal. Both pleural spaces are clear.

Case Discussion: The combination of calcified mediastinal nodes, lung 
fibrosis, nodules in a subpleural and along the fissures makes sarcoidosis 
the most likely diagnosis in a middle aged woman.

Calcified nodes are also commonly seen in previous TB infection and in 
people with an history of silica dust exposure .

TB can be associated with upper lobe fibrosis as can silicosis.

Lung nodules are usually present in cases of pneumoconiosis.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma

Patient Data: 
Age - 30
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation:A retroviral disease patient presented with a two-month 
history of fever, cough and loss of weight and appetite. Multiple 
purple-brown papules noted over head, scalp, neck, and trunk.

Description: Frontal chest radiograph showed reticular opacities and 
multiple parenchymal lung nodules.

2 months later: There is worsening reticular opacities in perihilar 
distributions and increasing size of the multiple lung nodules over a two 
month period -- initially treated as pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP).

Case Discussion: Histopathologic examination confirmed Kaposi Sarcoma. 

This patient has disseminated Kaposi Sarcoma (skin, lung, visceral and gut). The patient developed persistent episodes of diarrhea and a colonoscopy revealed multiple erythematous fungating lesions, extending from the rectum to cecum. After the patient started chemotherapy his condition improved, however after few months he succumbed to severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia with multiple organ dysfunction.

There are four variants of Kaposi Sarcoma:

classic form
endemic form (african)
iatrogenic (organ transplant related)
AIDS-related Kaposi Sarcoma
with the two latter form being the most common and disseminated form 1. 

Kaposi Sarcoma is caused by Human Herpes Virus type 8 1.

AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma is highly associated with patient who are male 
and homosexual and virus usually transmitted from the anal sexual 
intercourse 1. 

In this disseminated form, commonly involved organs include

1) Head & neck

cutaneous form with skin, face and neck nodules 1. 
mucosal form ( intra-oral, laryngeal and pharyngeal nodules 1. 
2)  Thoracic                        

CT has certain characteristic findings compared to chest radiograph with 
flame shape appearance of lung nodules (bilateral symmetrical ill defined 
nodules in peribronchovascular distributions 1). 

These nodules may presented with ""halo"" sign: ground glass opacities 
surrounding the nodules. Other associated findings include 
peribronchovascular and interlobular septal thickening, fissural nodularity, 
mediastinal, hilar and axillary adenopathy 1.

3) Liver & Spleen

Multiple hypo-attenuating nodules. Nodules may exhibit delayed enhancement 
distinguishing it from multiple hemangiomas 1. Lesions should be hyperechoic 
on ultrasound scan. 

4) Gastrointestinal tract

Can affect gastrointestinal tract from oropharynx to the rectum. Biopsy may 
be negative as it is a submucosal lesion 1.

In this case, with the abdominal findings, other differential diagnoses 
that were considered included fungal lesions in view of the liver and 
spleen lesions with concurrent intra-abdominal TB. He was treated for 
opportunistic infection with fungal (amphotericin) and challenge with TB 
treatment before he was subjected for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and 
chemotherapy. The initial chest radiograph was confused with PJP but the CT 
findings were characteristic for KS with absence of pleural effusion which 
may be present in PJP.

Diagnosis: Sclerotic rib lesion simulating a pulmonary nodule

Patient Data:
Age - 85
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Recent TAVI (transcatheter aortic valve implantation)

Description: Nodule projected in the left mid zone. Note how the nodule 
""moves"" relative to the lung but remains directly associated with the 
anterior aspect of the left fourth rib on both the PA and AP projections. 
This indicates that the lesion is associated with the rib which is 
confirmed when looking back at the prior TAVI planning CT. 

Case Discussion: Sclerotic rib lesions can mimic pulmonary nodules. The key 
is to look back at any prior radiographs. If the nodule remains projected 
over exactly the same rib site despite projectional differences then you 
can be confident that the lesions is within the rib rather than the lung.

Patient Presentation: History of thoracic aortic aneurysm on surveillance. 
Presenting with new AF.

Description: Cardiomediastinal contour is normal. When compared to prior 
imaging (not shown), persistent blunting of the right costophrenic recess 
is in keeping with longstanding pleural thickening. Ill-defined opacities 
in the right mid to lower zone with known round atelectasis.  No evidence 
of acute pulmonary edema. The left pleural space is clear.

Case Discussion: This patient has a known background of previous asbestos 
exposure and longstanding calcified and soft tissue pleural plaques. He had 
previous imaging in the past showing chronic round atelectasis in the right 
lung base and was under surveillance at vascular surgery due to an aortic 
arch aneurysm.

CTA showed a pleural mass and thoracic and extra-thoracic lymphadenopathy. 
Given the location of the mass and previous exposure to asbestos, the 
possibility of mesothelioma was raised. 

US-guided core biopsy was performed: 

Macroscopy: Labeled ""Right pleural lesion 16G core biopsy"". Core biopsy 19 
mm.

Microscopy: The biopsy core consists entirely of malignant tumor formed by 
partly necrotic sheets of atypical epithelioid cells. Tumor cells have 
moderately pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and a moderate amount 
of eosinophilic cytoplasm. No glandular or papillary arrangements are seen 
and there is no keratinization.
Immunostains have been performed and the tumor cells have the following 
immune profile:
Positive: HBME1, CK5/6 (patchy), calretinin (weak and focal), CK7 
(a small minority of cells only).
Negative: TTF1.

Additional immunostains have been performed and the tumor cells show strong 
positive staining for mesothelial markers EMA and WT1 and do not stain with 
the squamous marker p40. These findings support the original diagnosis of 
malignant mesothelioma. 

Conclusion: Right pleural lesion, core biopsy: Epithelioid mesothelioma.

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Former shipyard worker, with progressive shortness of 
breath and weight loss.

Description: Circumferential pleural thickening in the right thoracic cavity, 
with substantial volume loss within the right hemithorax.

Case Discussion: A mesothelioma, in general, is an aggressive malignant 
tumor, the vast majority arising from the pleural.

It is strongly associated with asbestos exposure, therefore afflicting 
those in industries with potential exposure, such as electricians and 
shipbuilders.  A significant lag response is known, being up to 20-30 
afters exposure.

It typically causes circumferential thickening of the pleura, encasing the 
lung with resultant volume loss.

Diagnosis: Epithelioid mesothelioma

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Chest pain and shortness of breath

Description: There is diffuse left hemithorax nodular pleural thickening 
encasing the lung and with, perhaps, some left hemithorax volume loss. A 
component of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Three small coils projected 
within the left hemithorax infer previous surgical intervention. The right 
lung and pleural space are clear. Enlarged left paratracheal stripe either 
represents lymphadenopathy or pleural mass component. 

Chasing for previous imaging or further CT recommended. 

Case Discussion: This patient was known to have confirmed pleural malignancy 
followed up in another service. 

He has previous left VATS: Macroscopy: Labeled ""Left pleural rind biopsy"".  
2 fragments of fatty tissue bearing an incomplete smooth pale grey lining 8 
x 5 x 3 mm and 14 x 9 x 5 mm.  Inked, serially sliced.

Microscopy: The biopsy fragments show fibroadipose connective tissue with 
surface fibrinous exudate. Within the submesothelial stroma, there is a 
proliferation of atypical epithelioid mesothelial cells forming small nests, 
trabeculae, and tight acinar arrangements. These cells have moderately 
pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and there are scattered mitotic 
figures. A sclerotic stromal reaction is present. The surrounding pleural 
tissue shows features of fibrous pleuritis with mild chronic inflammation. 
No alveolated lung tissue is included. Atypical cells do not extend into the 
adipose.
Immunoperoxidase stains have been performed on the mesothelial cells show 
positive staining for calretinin and CK 5/6, with no staining for EMA.
The findings are suspicious for malignant mesothelioma, however, the presence 
of adjacent fibrous pleurisy and the absence of invasion into the adipose 
tissue precludes a definite diagnosis.

Conclusion: Left pleural rind biopsy: Atypical mesothelial proliferation, 
suspicious for but not diagnostic of mesothelioma.

A second opinion from a different pathologist: features are in keeping with 
malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid subtype.

which is possibly calcified, and associated with a diaphragmatic peak sign.

On the lateral view, there is actually possibly three calcified pleural mass. 
The findings are atypical for mesothelioma, but this diagnosis should be

an alternate diagnosis. Loculated pleural effusion is less probable.

Case Discussion: Biopsy revealed sarcomatoid mesothelioma, the rarest 
subtype of mesothelioma (the others being epithelioid and biphasic). 
Spindle-cell mesothelioma, sarcomatous and diffuse malignant fibrous 
mesothelioma are other names for sarcomatoid mesothelioma. It accounts for 
approximately 10 % of pulmonary mesothelioma. Histologically, the findings 
are similar to histiocytoma. It contains spindle cells and must be 
differentiated from sarcoma.

Case Discussion: The differentiation between adenocarcinoma and mesothelioma 
can be difficult at histology. In this case, the initial histological 
diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma was revised following review of 
clinical and radiologal features, and the correct diagnosis was confirmed 
with special stains (calretinin, CK5/6, mesothelin and WT1) which are 
expressed in the majority of malignant mesotheliomas.

the disease is the left pleural space (including the pleural effusion, 
which are common), which in combination with the calcified pleural plaques 
makes mesothelioma the most likely primary - these clues are present on the 
presentation x-ray and on the post-thoracentesis x-ray incomplete expansion 
of the left apex with the peripherally density represents lung entrapment.

Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Left sided pleural effusion for evaluation. Possible 
asbestos exposure.

Description: Very subtle left sided pleural thickening is seen.

5 Years later: Five years later the patient presented with large left 
sided pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: Patients presented with pleural effusions associated with 
pleural thickening , the cause most probably fall in the neoplastic category 
especially if the thickening is nodular. The differential diagnosis of 
pleural thickening would include benign entities such as recurrent 
inflammation, recurrent pneumothoracies, seqaule of empyema or hemothorax 
and could be related to occupational or inhalational diseases such as 
asbestosis or silicosis. On the other hand, malignancy should be suspected 
if the pleural thickening is nodular or it is associated with pleural 
effusion. The differential diagnosis would include, primary neoplastic 
processes like mesothelioma, lymphoma and invasive thymoma or  secondaries 
from bronchogenic , breast, prostate, ovarian, gastrointestinal or renal 
cell carcinomas. Thoracic splenosis is a rare cause of plural nodular 
thickening.

Patient Presentation: Cough. Right-sided pleural effusion.

Description: Dense lower zone opacity.

Proximally the lung is enclosed by lobulated peripheral soft-tissue.

Case Discussion: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), which is associated 
with previous asbestos exposure in approximately 80% of cases, is the most 
common pleural malignancy.

Chest CT is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosis and staging of 
MPM. Key imaging findings of MPM include unilateral diffuse or nodular 
pleural thickening, unilateral pleural effusion, and multifocal studding of 
pleural surfaces.

Common radiographic features that indicate asbestos exposure include round 
atelectasis of the lower lobes, pleural plaques and pleural fibrosis.

associated with a cough. Mild improvement with previous medicine. No recent 
travel history, no close contact with covid 19 positive cases. COVID-19 
negative - a test was done two days ago. On examination: throat congested,

Case Discussion: Normal pleural space is lined by a thin film of fluid. 
Visceral and parietal pleura are in opposition and glide over each other 
during respiration.

When excess fluid accumulates in pleural space, it is called pleural 
effusion.

Pleural effusion is divided into transudates & exudates according to the 
biochemical analysis of aspirated pleural fluid.

Diagnosis: Pleural effusion

Patient Data:
Age - 40
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Patient presents with low grade fever since 1 month 
associated with cough, minimal expectoration and dyspnea (NYHA 3). The 
patient also complains of loss of 7 kg body weight.

Description: A homogenous opacification is noted in the right lower zone 
with the opacity seen to track along the lateral chest wall. The right 
costophrenic angle is obliterated with a meniscus noted. Findings are 
suggestive of a right sided pleural effusion.

Fibrotic opacities are noted in the right apical zone suggestive of an old 
healed infective etiology.

Case Discussion: A small amount of effusion accumulates in a subpulmonic 
location, causing slight elevation of the hemidiaphragm.

As the fluid increases, the fluid starts to spill over into the most 
dependent costophrenic sulci.

Fluid accumulating posteriorly can be seen on the lateral view before it 
becomes visible on the frontal view.

When the fluid is slightly above the level of the upper portion of the 
diaphragm, blunting of the lateral costophrenic angle is seen. This is the 
earliest sign of pleural effusion on the frontal view.

 A minimal amount of fluid (approximately 175 mL) is required to produce 
detectable blunting. As much as 500 mL of pleural fluid can be present 
without apparent changes on the frontal view.

A large free pleural effusion appears as a dependent opacity with lateral 
upward sloping of a meniscus-shaped contour.

The diaphragmatic contour is partially or completely obliterated, depending 
on the amount of the fluid (silhouette sign).

Because the fluid is laterally tangential to the x-ray beam, the depth of 
fluid penetration increases and consequently increases attenuation of the 
radiation. The depth of the fluid penetrated anteriorly and posteriorly is 
small, especially in the upper portion of the effusion.

A very large pleural effusion appears as an opaque hemithorax with a 
mediastinal shift to the contralateral side. The mediastinal shift can be 
less prominent or even absent in the presence of underlying lung pathology 
(eg, atelectasis) or contralateral hemithorax abnormality.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Metastatic pleural effusion due to lung adenocarcinoma

Patient Data: 
Age - 75
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increasing shortness of breath and background of lung 
cancer.

Description: There is a large opacity of the right hilar, suprahilar and 
upper zone region which is consistent with the known primary lung cancer. 
The right lower zone is opacified which could represent right lower lobe 
collapse with an elevated right hemi diaphragm. The opacity could 
alternatively represent a soft tissue lesion or loculated pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: This is an interesting case of abnormal chest x-ray which 
can be mistaken for an elevated hemidiaphragm. The mediastinum is displaced 
to the left and the right hemidiaphragm is displaced inferiorly because the 
volume of the loculated pleural collection is greater than the loss of 
volume in the right lung. 

The patient had multiple previous pleural taps for pleural effusion. 
The pleural fluid had previously been sent for cytology which had showed 
malignant cells consistent with lung adenocarcinoma. The appearance of the 
pleural effusion compared to previous had evolved from a simple pleural 
effusion to a loculated effusion. This explains why the appearance on the 
CXR no longer shows the typical meniscus sign and instead artificially 
gives the impression of an elevated hemidiaphragm. 

Regarding cancer staging the tumor size (>7cm) equates to T4, the 
involvement of contralateral mediastinal lymph nodes equates to N3 and the 
presence of malignant pleural effusion equates to M1a. The overall IASLC 
8th edition staging being IVa.

On lateral projection only one pleural cavity is visible (the left one).


Annotated Images;  Signs of positive mass effect on the right include: 

shift of the mediastinum and trachea (blue) to the left
leftward bowing of the azygo-esophageal recess (yellow)
splaying of the ribs on the right (red)
On the lateral film one knows that the affected side is the right because: 

the aortic arch is visible (orange)
the visible hemidiaphragm and pleural surface (green) abuts the posterior 
border of the heart (IVC)
gastric air bubble (purple) abuts the visible hemidiaphragm
Note that the film has been obtained with the right side against the film 
(opposite to normal) and thus it is the left hemidiaphragm which is 
magnified.

Patient Presentation : Chest pain

Description: There is extensive pleural opacity on the left encasing the 
lung and extending onto the mediastinal surface typical for malignant 
pleural disease. The opacity extends to the mid thorax level with a 
meniscus indicating at least some fluid however the relative amounts of 
solid tumor vs pleural fluid cannot be determined by plain film. 
Interstitial opacity is seen in the remaining aerated lung in the left

cardiomediastinal contours are obscured on the left.

Case Discussion: On further questioning of the patient's history it was 
discovered that there is a past history of mesothelioma, which would fit 
with this appearance of pleural tumor encasing the left lung. Pleural 
thickening that extends onto the mediastinum should always be regarded with 
suspicion. Other clues that may be helpful include calcified pleural 
plaques indicating asbestos exposure, missing ribs indicating either 
metastases or previous surgery, and surgical clues such as an absent breast 
shadow, axillary surgical clips, etc.

Case Discussion: This represents a case of pleural effusion (PF), defined as 
the accumulation of fluid between the parietal and visceral pleura.

PF may be due to several underlying diseases, including heart failure, 
cancer, pulmonary embolism, and infection.

In this case, laboratory findings revealed an elevated white count 
(13.5 x103/mcL).

A combination of cefepime and azithromycin used for treatment improved her 
condition.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: Subpulmonic pleural effusion
-Calcification

Patient Data: 
Age - 80
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and decreased air entry 
at right lung base.

Description: Elevation of the right lung base with apparent lateralization 
of the diaphragmatic apex.

Increased cardio-thoracic ratio.

C-shaped mitral annular calcification.

Case Discussion: 
This case demonstrates the x-ray appearance of a right-sided subpulmonic 
pleural effusion.  There is an apparent elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
The apex of this pseudohemidiaphragm is displaced laterally, and this 
suggests a subpulmonic effusion as the diagnosis rather than a true raised 
hemidiaphragm1.  Subsequent CT demonstrates a pleural effusion which is 
posteriorly located with the patient supine.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: Massive pleural effusion

Patient Data:
Age - 65
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increasing dyspnea, dry cough, poor appetite, fatigue 
and lethargy.

Description: A right-sided pleural effusion with total white-out of the 
right hemithorax and minor mediastinal shift to the left.

Minor left-sided pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: Unilateral white-out can be due to collapse, consolidation, 
effusion or a combination and the position of the mediastinum is key to 
diagnosis. Massive pleural effusion causes contralateral shift however 
the degree of shift depends on the degree of accompanying pulmonary collapse.

In this case, the appearance suggests a massive right pleural effusion with 
collapse of the right lung.

Patient Presentation: Fever, shortness of breath, sweats, cough, and left chest pain.

Description:Rounded opacity is adjacent to the left hilum.

Air bronchograms traverse the lesion, features are typical of round pneumonia.

Follow up - Follow-up X-ray after 6 days of treatment demonstrating rapid improvement.

Case Discussion: These features are consistent with round pneumonia. 

Round pneumonia is a type of pneumonia usually only seen in pediatric patients. 
They are well defined, rounded opacities that represent regions of infected 
consolidation, it often indicates streptococcal pneumonia.

Round pneumonias are well-circumscribed parenchymal opacities, they tend to 
have irregular margins. They most commonly occur in superior segments of 
lower lobes and in the majority of cases (98%), they are solitary. 
Air bronchograms are often present.

Patient Data:
Age - 60
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough and loss of weight over five weeks

Description: Large cavitating right upper lobe mass with cavitation. Left lung is clear. 
Normal cardiomediastinal contour.

4 weeks post Rx - There is been a significant decrease in the size of the cavitating 
right upper lobe mass, this is consistent with a resolving area of infection.

Case Discussion(Cultures and Cytology): The patient proceeded to bronchoalveolar lavage, with 
specimens sent for MC&S and cytology. 

Culture:

MICROSCOPY / GRAM STAIN

Pus Cells +
Squamous Epithelial Cells Not Detected
Gram positive cocci +
CULTURE

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) ++

Cytology:

MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The smears are composed of acute inflammatory 
exudate with occasional scattered bronchial cells in the background. No 
fungal elements demonstrated on Grocott stain. No malignant cells are 
identified.

DIAGNOSIS: Bronchial Washings: Acute inflammation; negative for malignancy.

Case Discussion: This is a very large cavitating pneumonia with a subacute 
presentation. The key differential for this is malignancy, however, the degree 
of consolidation is very large and cavitation small and this would favor 
infection over malignancy. Follow-up demonstrated marked reduction in size, 
also in keeping with infection rather than malignancy.

Diagnosis: Klebsiella pneumonia

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Tachypneic and febrile

Description: Extensive right upper lobe consolidation, with bulging of the 
horizontal fissure.

Sputum analysis grew Klebsiella pneumoniae.

Case Discussion: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a gram negative organism that 
usually affects people with alcoholism or chronic debilitating diseases 
(similar to other gram -ve pneumonias). On CXR, consolidation is lobar and 
resembles streptococcus pneumonia. Lobar expansion (e.g. bulging of the 
horizontal fissure in this case) is less common nowadays with modern 
antibiotic treatment. Also, lobar expansion is not specific for Klebsiella 
infection.

A helpful feature which may help to distinguish from pneumococcal pneumonia 
is that Klebsiella pneumonia develops cavitation in 30-50% of cases. 
This occurs early and progresses quickly. Massive necrosis (pulmonary 
gangrene) is a recognized complication. In comparison, cavitation is rare 
in pneumococcal pneumonia.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Pneumothorax

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Right sided chest pain.

Description: A very large right-sided pneumothorax is present. There is the 
suggesting of minimal shift of the cardiomediastinal contents towards the 
left suggesting a degree of developing tension. No left-sided abnormality 
evident.

Case Discussion: This is a very large pneumothorax requires recognition and rapid decompression.

If there is any concern of a tension pneumothorax then even if all you 
perform is a needle thoracostomy inserted in the 2nd intercostal space in 
the midclavicular line you may well save a life as you gain valuable time 
before a larger underwater drain can be inserted.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Pneumothorax

Patient Data: 
Age - 25
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: 1 week history of cough and coryza. Sudden onset 
shortness of breath after a coughing episode. Low oxygen saturations.

Description: Subtle left apical pneumothorax with lung edge visible just 
above left 3rd rib.  The lungs are otherwise clear. 

Case Discussion: The line formed by the lung edge is nearly parallel to the 
3rd rib which can make this pneumothorax hard to spot. It is important to 
include the lung apices as a 'review area' when assessing a CXR.

Patient Presentation: Left sided pleuritic chest pain

Description: Large left-sided pneumothorax with almost complete collapse of 
the left lung. 

After intercostal catheter: Left intercostal catheter has been inserted. 
Left lung has re-inflated with a residual left apical pneumothorax. 

Case Discussion: There is no evidence of tension in this spontaneous 
pneumothorax. Most of these are thought to arise from a subpleural bleb or 
bullae, although areas of pleural inflammation may also be a cause.

Patient Presentation: Sudden onset right sided chest pain.

Description: Right sided pneumothorax is noted measuring 2.1 cm in right 
upper zone. Lungs are clear. Both CP angles are not included. 
Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Pneumothorax is the identification of air within the 
pleural space. It can be divided into primary (no underlying lung disease), 
secondary  (has underlying lung disease) and iatrogenic/traumatic categories.

This patient presented with a spontaneous right sided pneumothorax.

Diagnosis: Apical pneumothorax
-Small bilateral pleural effusions

Patient Data: 
Age - 65
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: History of COPD. Increasing breathlessness over a week, 
woke with worsening breathlessness.

Description: Hyperinflated lungs with upper and mid-zone emphysema.

Small bilateral pleural effusions.

Small right apical pneumothorax.

The heart is enlarged with evidence of pulmonary congestion.

No displaced rib fractures.

After acute deterioration in saturations/Increased work of breathing:

The right hemithorax is increased in lucency compared to the left, 
with little technical rotation.

The apical pneumothorax is not well visualized, however there is air 
adjacent to the right paratracheal stripe.

A small volume of subcutaneous emphsyema is also present.

After intercostal tube: Right-sided intercostal tube, oriented apically, 
has been placed for decompression of the pneumothorax.

Marked increase in the volume of subcutaneous emphysema.

Case Discussion: This case is important to remind you to examine the 
""never-miss"" areas of the radiograph, in this case the apex.

The patient required an emergency chest drain as the small pneumothorax was 
not detected by the clinical staff until the patient deteriorated further.

In the absence of trauma, bullous disease is the most likely root of the 
pneumothorax, especially in patients with underlying emphysema or asthma.

Patient Presentation: Sudden onset pleuritic chest pain, with progressive 
dyspnea leading to presentation at hospital. Reduced air entry on right side, 
with hyper-resonance on examination. Reduced saturations on room air. 
Ex-smoker. No significant respiratory history.

Description: There is a large right sided pneumothorax.

The trachea is central, however the patient is rotated to the right. 
There is mediastinal shift to the left and rib splaying on the right.

No displaced rib fractures.

After drain/re-expansion: Right sided intercostal drain in situ.

Re-expansion of the lung with normal lung volume.

Case discussion: Spontaneous pneumothorax with early signs of tension.

This was quickly recognized by the clinical team who treated this with 
insertion of an intercostal chest drain. This is appropriately oriented to 
the apex of the lung.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Neonatal pneumothorax


Patient Presentation: Neonatal pneumothorax with chest drain in situ. 
Persistent high pressures required.

Description: There is a large right pneumothorax demonstrated on AP and 
lateral films with a pig-tail catheter in situ with its tip at the apex. 

Case discussion: Large right supine pneumothorax with a drain in situ.

The lateral radiograph demonstrates why the drain isn't working. In a 
neonate, the anterior (and not apical) chest is anti-dependant and that is 
where the collection of gas in the hemithorax is.

The neonatologist was about to put a new chest tube in when the film was 
reported - a telephone call to the team and subsequent manipuation of the 
tube saved the child from another intervention and the pneumothorax was 
drained successfully.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Basal pneumothorax

Patient data:
Age - 40
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: No trauma sustained. Sudden shortness of breath, 
? pneumothorax.

Description: There is a right basal pneumothorax seen with maximum 
interpleural distance measuring 4.6 cm. No mediastinal shift, 
consolidation nor pleural effusion is observed.

After 20 hours: The right pneumothorax previously seen is relatively 
larger compared to the previous day.

After 30 hours: There is interval insertion of a right-sided intercostal 
catheter. Interval reduction of right pneumothorax is noted with maximal 
pleural separation of about 1.2 cm in the current study. No frank 
consolidation or sizable pleural effusion is seen.

Case Discussion: Despite pneumothoraces often being observed either 
apically or as a rim around the upper portion of the lung edge, this case 
depicts a pneumothorax at the basal aspect of the right lung.

Conservative management was first attempted but proved unsuccessful, as 
seen on the chest image done 20 hours after initial presentation. An 
intercostal catheter was subsequently inserted, which then allowed for 
reduction of the pneumothorax.

Spontaneous pneumothoraces are a medical emergency. In some parts of the 
world (i.e. Australia 1), it is required that the radiographers alerts the 
referring doctor on this finding so that early intervention can proceed.

Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Toppled to the right side. She subsequently 
experienced thoracic tenderness and mild shortness of breath.

Description: Fractures of the right ribs 3-8 with obvious displacement of 
the 5th and 6th ribs. The thin pleural line and the lack of the pulmonary 
vessels in the right apex are clearly visible reflecting a pneumothorax. 
Subcutaneous emphysema of the thoracic wall.

Zoomed view: The zoomed view clearly demonstrates the thin pleural line and 
the lack of the pulmonary vessels in the right apex.

After thoracic drain: After insertion of a thoracic drain, there is partial 
resolution of the pneumothorax. Additionally, there is a small pleural 
effusion and progressive subcutaneous emphysema of the thoracic wall.

Case Discussion: The first x-rays taken in the ED reveal multiple, 
partially displaced rib fractures and a pneumothorax on the right side.

After insertion of a thoracic drain, felt necessary due to the multiple 
fractures, progressive shortness of breath and the presence of pleural 
space air, the pneumothorax has partially resolved.

Case Discussion: Chest pain, breathlessness, and severe coughing are 
symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).

Pulmonary TB is curable with an early diagnosis and antibiotic treatment, 
but can be life-threatening if a person does not receive treatment.

People with active TB can spread the bacteria through the air. After the 
patient is diagnosed, they should hence not be in contact with others 
before undergoing treatment.

Diagnosis Almost Certain
Diagnosis: Post-primary tuberculosis

Patient Data:
Age - 20
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Non-specific cough for last three months. Good social 
status.

Description: Diffuse reticular and micronodular pattern with a predilection 
for upper and middle zones. There is a mass in the middle zone of the right 
lung and two cavities in the middle and upper zones of the left lung.

Case Discussion: Although tuberculosis is mainly a problem in developing 
countries, there is a rising incidence in developed countries too. 
Therefore it is important to use chest x-ray as a relatively low dose 
clinical test which returns valuable results, especially in younger 
patients with uncertain airway changes.

Previous contact with tuberculosis was not reported in this case, and the 
bronchial lavage smear for acid-fast bacilli was positive. The CT was 
performed to exclude other thoracic pathologies.
