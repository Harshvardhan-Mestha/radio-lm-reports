Case by: Daniel Patti
Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of lifeâ€‹.
