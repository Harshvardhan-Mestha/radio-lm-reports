Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

            Predicted Explanation e':Explanation: The X-ray image shows a significant area of the lung, particularly in the lower left zone, where there appears to be a volume loss and shift, indicative of atelectasis. The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, and there is an evident displacement of the structures such as the mediastinum towards the left side, which is consistent with lung collapse. The recognition of these hallmark features supports the identification of atelectasis over pneumonia, which typically presents as more diffuse or patchy consolidations without evidence of significant lung volume loss and mediastinal shift.

Diagnosis: Bilateral atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 35
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Left chest pain, 1 week post splenectomy

Description: Bilateral symmetrical curvilinear opacities extending 
superolaterally from the lower mediastinum. They are separate from the 
oblique fissure on the lateral projection, most likely to be atelectasis.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is common after large surgical procedures, 
patients will often present with chest pain native to the side of collapse. 
Subsegmental atelectasis like this is often best visualized on computed 
tomography.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/48666
            Predicted Explanation e':Explanation: The X-ray image indicates a possibility of atelectasis. This can be inferred from the visible increased opacity and a significant reduction in lung volume, evident predominantly in the left lung zone where the lung appears somewhat collapsed. The image also shows an elevation of the diaphragm on the affected side (left), which is a common finding in cases of atelectasis. Additionally, signs such as a slight deviation of the trachea towards the affected side reinforce this diagnosis.

Diagnosis: Left lower lobe atelectasis

Patient Data:
Age - 30
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Post thoracostomy for stab wound.

Description: Satisfactory position of the ETT and left chest drain.

Small volume left lung. Increased left lower zone attenuation due to left 
lower lobe atelectasis which obscures the descending aorta and left 
hemidiaphragm. The area contains an air-filled bronchus, the diaphragm is 
elevated and the heart is shifted to the left.

Case Discussion: This is a typical appearance of left lower lobe atelectasis 
later confirmed by CT.

            Predicted Explanation e':Explanation: The X-ray image displays findings consistent with atelectasis. This is suggested by the increased opacity present near the left lung zone along with a notable reduction in lung volume in that area.

Additionally, the trachea appears slightly deviated towards the left side, which further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis.

Diagnosis: Cicatricial atelectasis right middle lobe

Patient Data: 
Age - 80
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Chronic Cough

Description: Pulmonary hyperinflation, right middle lobe atelectasis. 
No edema, pneumonia or pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is the term used to describe deflated lung. 
There are multiple different causes of atelectasis but in the absence of 
endobronchial obstruction, surfactant deficiency, pneumothorax, or an 
adjacent space-occupying lesion compressing the lung, the most likely cause 
is scarring. Atelectasis due to scarring is called cicatricial or 
cicatrisation atelectasis and is often due to prior infection, especially 
mycobacterial.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/171798
            Predicted Explanation e':Explanation: The X-ray image shows evidence suggesting pneumonia, identifiable by the presence of patchy and diffuse opacities in the mid to lower lung zones. The diffuse nature of these opacities is more consistent with pneumonia, which often manifests as scattered areas of consolidation within the lung fields. The lack of significant volume loss or tracheal deviation further supports the diagnosis of pneumonia over atelectasis. Additionally, there is no notable elevation of the diaphragm or teardrop shape in the lung, which would be more indicative of atelectasis. These findings collectively point towards pneumonia rather than atelectasis.

Diagnosis: Cicatricial atelectasis right middle lobe

Patient Data: 
Age - 80
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Chronic Cough

Description: Pulmonary hyperinflation, right middle lobe atelectasis. 
No edema, pneumonia or pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is the term used to describe deflated lung. 
There are multiple different causes of atelectasis but in the absence of 
endobronchial obstruction, surfactant deficiency, pneumothorax, or an 
adjacent space-occupying lesion compressing the lung, the most likely cause 
is scarring. Atelectasis due to scarring is called cicatricial or 
cicatrisation atelectasis and is often due to prior infection, especially 
mycobacterial.

This determination is based on the visible increased opacity and the noticeable reduction in lung volume on the left side, where the lung appears partially collapsed. Additionally, there seems to be a slight shift of the trachea towards the left, which is a common feature of atelectasis as the lung deflates and pulls mediastinal structures towards it. The diaphragmatic elevation on the left side further supports this diagnosis.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Lung cancer causing complete atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough and SOB

Description: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with 
findings of volume loss such as shift of the mediastinum to the left and 
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating that the left lung is 
atelectatic. There is abrupt "cut off" of the left main bronchus, 
suggesting that the bronchus is obstructed.

Case Discussion: The two most common reasons for complete opacification of a 
hemithorax are complete atelectasis of a lung and a massive pleural effusion. 
This case illustrates characteristic features of "white out" due to 
atelectasis, in this case due to lung cancer obstructing the left main 
bronchus. Mediastinal shift toward the atelectatic lung and elevation of 
the diaphragm are especially well seen on the coronal images.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/96100
            Predicted Explanation e':Explanation: The X-ray image shows findings indicative of atelectasis, particularly in the left lung. This is evidenced by the increased opacity and the apparent volume loss on the left side of the chest. The lung on the left side appears to be less expanded, which is characteristic of atelectasis where part of the lung is collapsed or not fully inflated. Additionally, the trachea appears to be deviated towards the left, which commonly occurs in atelectasis as the mediastinal structures shift toward the side with the collapsed lung. The elevated left diaphragm further supports this diagnosis. These observations are consistent with atelectasis rather than pneumonia, which typically shows more patchy and widespread opacities throughout the lung fields without significant lung volume reduction or tracheal deviation.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

There is also evidence of an elevated diaphragm on the left side, further supporting the diagnosis of atelectasis.

Additionally, the trachea appears to be slightly deviated towards the same side, which is a common indicator of atelectasis.

These findings are consistent with atelectasis rather than pneumonia, which typically presents as more patchy and diffuse opacities throughout the lung zones without significant volume loss or tracheal deviation.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\nExplanation: The X-ray image indicates a possibility of atelectasis. This can be inferred from the visible increased opacity and a significant reduction in lung volume, evident predominantly in the left lung zone where the lung appears somewhat collapsed. The image also shows an elevation of the diaphragm on the affected side (left), which is a common finding in cases of atelectasis. Additionally, signs such as a slight deviation of the trachea towards the affected side reinforce this diagnosis. Unlike pneumonia, which often presents with more patchy and diffuse opacities, atelectasis is characterized by these patterns of volume loss and opacity in specific sections of the lung.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\nExplanation: The X-ray image displays findings consistent with atelectasis. This is suggested by the increased opacity present near the left lung zone along with a notable reduction in lung volume in that area. The lung appears less inflated, which aligns with the characteristic appearance of atelectasis where there is a collapse or incomplete expansion of the lung. Additionally, the trachea appears slightly deviated towards the left side, which further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis.

This determination is based on the visible increased opacity and the noticeable reduction in lung volume on the left side, where the lung appears partially collapsed. Additionally, there seems to be a slight shift of the trachea towards the left, which is a common feature of atelectasis as the lung deflates and pulls mediastinal structures towards it.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Left lower lobe atelectasis

Patient Data:
Age - 30
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Post thoracostomy for stab wound.

Description: Satisfactory position of the ETT and left chest drain.

Small volume left lung. Increased left lower zone attenuation due to left 
lower lobe atelectasis which obscures the descending aorta and left 
hemidiaphragm. The area contains an air-filled bronchus, the diaphragm is 
elevated and the heart is shifted to the left.

Case Discussion: This is a typical appearance of left lower lobe atelectasis 
later confirmed by CT.

This is evidenced by the increased opacity and the reduction in lung volume on the left side, where the lung appears collapsed or underinflated. The trachea also appears to be slightly deviated towards the left, which is a common indicator of atelectasis, as the mediastinal structures shift toward the collapsed side.

This can be inferred from the visible increased opacity and a significant reduction in lung volume, evident predominantly in the left lung zone where the lung appears somewhat collapsed.

This is suggested by the increased opacity present near the left lung zone along with a notable reduction in lung volume in that area. The lung appears less inflated, which aligns with the characteristic appearance of atelectasis where there is a collapse or incomplete expansion of the lung. Additionally, the trachea appears slightly deviated towards the left side, which further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis.

This determination is based on the visible increased opacity and the noticeable reduction in lung volume on the left side, where the lung appears partially collapsed. Additionally, there seems to be a slight shift of the trachea towards the left, which is a common feature of atelectasis as the lung deflates and pulls mediastinal structures towards it.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Lung cancer causing complete atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough and SOB

Description: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with 
findings of volume loss such as shift of the mediastinum to the left and 
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating that the left lung is 
atelectatic. There is abrupt "cut off" of the left main bronchus, 
suggesting that the bronchus is obstructed.

Case Discussion: The two most common reasons for complete opacification of a 
hemithorax are complete atelectasis of a lung and a massive pleural effusion. 
This case illustrates characteristic features of "white out" due to 
atelectasis, in this case due to lung cancer obstructing the left main 
bronchus. Mediastinal shift toward the atelectatic lung and elevation of 
the diaphragm are especially well seen on the coronal images.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/96100
            Predicted Explanation e':Explanation: The X-ray image shows findings characteristic of atelectasis. There is a noticeable increase in opacity in the right lung zone along with a significant reduction in lung volume. The right lung appears more collapsed, indicated by the decreased aeration and consolidation. Additionally, the heart and mediastinum are shifted towards the right side, which is a hallmark sign of atelectasis when the lung deflates and pulls mediastinal structures towards it. This pattern is different from pneumonia, which typically presents with more patchy and diffuse opacities rather than centralized volume loss and mediastinal shift. The observed elevation of the right diaphragm further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis.

Diagnosis: Pneumonia
-COPD

Patient Symptoms: 2-day history of pleuritic chest pain, cough and fever with
a background of COPD.

Patient Data:
Age - 65
Gender - Female

Description: Situs inversus totalis. There is a large rounded mass in the left
mid lower zone.

6 Week follow up -- Complete resolution of the left mid-lower zone mass.

Case Discussion: This is a case of situs inversus totalis and rounded pneumonia.
Subsequently the patient was diagnosed with pneumococcal pneumonia(positive
pneumococcal urinary antigens). A follow-up chest X-ray 6 weeks later showed
radiological resolution of the mass-like consolidation.

Diagnosis: Influenza A pneumonia

Patient Data:
Age - 60
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Admitted early March 2020, somewhere in the middle of
nowhere in Germany with fever, dry cough, pleuritic pain, hypoxia, and hypocapnia.

Description Frontal/Lateral: Midly increased cardiothoracic ratio(CTR): 52%
Patchy, bilateral infiltrates, and airspace opacification predominantly in the mid
and lower lung zones. No visible pleural effusions.

Case Discussion: This case illustrates and shows the most common findings of influenza
A pneumonia, a combination of multifocal ground-glass opacities(GGO) and irregular consolidations,
mainly along and around the bronchovascular bundles.
 
Real-time polymerase chain reaction(PCR) after respiratory swab was positive
for influenza A virus RNA.

The patient was put under isolation and recieved supportive and antiviral
therapy(oseltamivir) and an antibiotic regimen covering gram-positive
cocci for 7 days. After a hospital course of 8 days, the patient recovered
and was released home in a vastly improved condition.

Outpatient follow-up CT, 3 weeks later, was normal and showed complete resolution
of the ground glass opacities and consolidations.

Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: The patient came for right lower chest pain for 3 days,
fever, cough, and dyspnea, no loss of weight, no contact with the covid-19 case,
nonsmoker, no chronic disease before.

Description Initial Image: Mildy elevated right hemidiaphragm is noted.
Patchy consolidation is seen in the right lower zone, erasing the edge of the heart.
Air bronchogram sign is noted.

After 10 days of Rx: There is an improvement in the chest x-ray compared with the last
test. The right lower lung zone shows a haziness area with a band-like opacity
(sequelae of previous pneumonia). Both CP angles are free.

Case Discussion: The improvement of the radiographic appearance after treatment
and the clarity of the right heart edge indicates that the pneumonia was in the right
middle lobe of the lung.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

There is no significant evidence of patchy opacities or consolidations that are typical findings in cases of pneumonia.

Patient Presentation: Left chest pain, 1 week post splenectomy

Description: Bilateral symmetrical curvilinear opacities extending 
superolaterally from the lower mediastinum. They are separate from the 
oblique fissure on the lateral projection, most likely to be atelectasis.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is common after large surgical procedures, 
patients will often present with chest pain native to the side of collapse. 
Subsegmental atelectasis like this is often best visualized on computed 
tomography.

Diagnosis: Cicatricial atelectasis right middle lobe

Patient Data: 
Age - 80
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Chronic Cough

Description: Pulmonary hyperinflation, right middle lobe atelectasis. 
No edema, pneumonia or pleural effusion.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is the term used to describe deflated lung. 
There are multiple different causes of atelectasis but in the absence of 
endobronchial obstruction, surfactant deficiency, pneumothorax, or an 
adjacent space-occupying lesion compressing the lung, the most likely cause 
is scarring. Atelectasis due to scarring is called cicatricial or 
cicatrisation atelectasis and is often due to prior infection, especially 
mycobacterial.

Diagnosis: Lung cancer causing complete atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough and SOB

Description: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with 
findings of volume loss such as shift of the mediastinum to the left and 
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating that the left lung is 
atelectatic. There is abrupt "cut off" of the left main bronchus, 
suggesting that the bronchus is obstructed.

Case Discussion: The two most common reasons for complete opacification of a 
hemithorax are complete atelectasis of a lung and a massive pleural effusion. 
This case illustrates characteristic features of "white out" due to 
atelectasis, in this case due to lung cancer obstructing the left main 
bronchus. Mediastinal shift toward the atelectatic lung and elevation of 
the diaphragm are especially well seen on the coronal images.

Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/45643
            Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation" - The given X-ray shows a noticeable shift of the mediastinum towards the left side, which is a classic sign of atelectasis. Atelectasis involves the collapse of lung tissue, leading to volume loss. The left lung appears significantly reduced in volume and there is a mediastinal shift that suggests an ipsilateral (same side) collapse, further pointing towards atelectasis as the diagnosis over pneumonia, which would generally not cause such a shift. The density pattern seen is more typical of a volume loss process rather than an inflammatory/infectious process like pneumonia.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Lung cancer causing complete atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 70
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Cough and SOB

Description: There is complete opacification of the left hemithorax with 
findings of volume loss such as shift of the mediastinum to the left and 
elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, indicating that the left lung is 
atelectatic. There is abrupt "cut off" of the left main bronchus, 
suggesting that the bronchus is obstructed.

Case Discussion: The two most common reasons for complete opacification of a 
hemithorax are complete atelectasis of a lung and a massive pleural effusion. 
This case illustrates characteristic features of "white out" due to 
atelectasis, in this case due to lung cancer obstructing the left main 
bronchus. Mediastinal shift toward the atelectatic lung and elevation of 
the diaphragm are especially well seen on the coronal images.

Link: https://radiopaedia.org/cases/96100
            Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a noticeable increase in opacity in the left upper lung region, indicating a loss of lung volume. The trachea and mediastinal structures are deviating towards the left, which is a typical sign of atelectasis as the lung collapses and pulls the surrounding structures with it. The left hemidiaphragm appears to be elevated, which further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis. These findings suggest that part of the lung on the left side is collapsed or not fully inflated.

Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

Case Discussion: Atelectasis is common after large surgical procedures, 
patients will often present with chest pain native to the side of collapse. 
Subsegmental atelectasis like this is often best visualized on computed

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a noticeable increase in opacity in the lung region, indicating a loss of lung volume. There is also an apparent shift in anatomical structures, such as the trachea and mediastinum, towards the area of increased opacity. These signs suggest a collapse of the lung or part of it. The evident elevation of the diaphragm further supports the diagnosis of atelectasis, as these are hallmark indicators of the condition. These findings collectively suggest that part of the lung is collapsed or not fully inflated.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Round atelectasis

Patient Data: 
Age - 60
Gender - Female


Patient Presentation: Follow-up imaging for a patient with a recent past 
history of hydropneumothorax and chronic liver disease.

Description: Right-sided pleural fluid collection with fluid tracking into 
the oblique fissure.
Round area of opacity adjacent to the pleura in the right lower zone.
CT of the chest was recommended to further characterize the round opacity.

Case Discussion: Although the CT features were characteristic of round 
atelectasis, the area of hyperdensity was biopsied in this case. This is 
not typical, since cases with the characteristic CT features of round 
atelectasis are generally not biopsied and managed conservatively with 
follow-up imaging. A biopsy of round atelectasis will inevitably contain 
scant lung parenchymal tissue and may lead to clinician uncertainty and 
repeated unnecessary invasive procedures. As such, a biopsy should only be
performed where imaging findings are indeterminate.

The histopathology report in this case described limited tissue containing 
pneumocytes with patchy mild interstitial chronic inflammation, and no 
features of malignancy.

The consistent increase in density and abnormal positioning of the lung structures support the diagnosis of atelectasis.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows a significant increase in opacity in the right lung field, which suggests a loss of lung volume in that region. Additionally, there is an evident shift of the mediastinal structures towards the right side, indicating a mediastinal shift. The right hemidiaphragm also appears elevated, which are classic signs of atelectasis. These observations collectively indicate that the lung or a part of it has collapsed or is not fully inflated, which is indicative of atelectasis.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows several features indicative of atelectasis. There is a noticeable increase in opacity, especially in the central region of the chest, which suggests a loss of lung volume. Furthermore, the visible shift in the anatomical structures, such as the mediastinum towards the side of increased opacity, is a common sign of atelectasis. These observations collectively point towards the collapse or incomplete inflation of a part of the lung.\n\nDiagnosis: Atelectasis\n\n"Explanation": The X-ray image shows an area of increased opacity in the region of the lung, which suggests a loss of lung volume typical of atelectasis. The density of the area appears consolidated, and there is a visible shift in anatomical structures, such as the trachea and mediastinum, which are hallmark signs of lung collapse or partial collapse. The right hemidiaphragm seems elevated, further supporting a loss of volume in the lung. These observations collectively point towards atelectasis as the most likely diagnosis.\n\n            '}

Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Endobronchial valves for emphysema
-Atelectasis
-COPD

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Female

Patient Presentation: Increased work of breathing and cough, decreased air 
entry bilaterally with expiratory wheeze loudest over the right base. Known 
severe COPD on home oxygen, FEV1 0.75L (25% predicted), DLCO 55% predicted.

Description: The lungs are severely emphysematous but no consolidation or 
pleural collection is demonstrated. Right lower lobe endobronchial valves 
are noted. Bilateral lower zone atelectasis or scarring. Heart size and 
cardiomediastinal contours are normal.

Case Discussion: Endobronchial valves reduce the flow of air into the 
treated lobe during inspiration whilst allowing secretions and air to be 
expelled from that region during expiration. Its intention is to cause 
localized atelectasis in the target lobe, matching the size of the lungs to 
the size of the thorax containing them, thereby causing improvement in lung 
function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life​.

        Predicted Explanation e':"Explanation": The X-ray image shows increased opacity in the right lung region, indicating a potential loss of lung volume common in atelectasis. There is also a visible shift in the trachea and mediastinum towards the right, which is a hallmark sign of atelectasis as the lung collapses and pulls the surrounding structures with it. The right hemidiaphragm appears elevated, further supporting the diagnosis of atelectasis. These signs collectively suggest that a part of the lung on the right side is collapsed or not fully inflated.

        True Explanation e: Case by: Mohamed Mahmoud Elthokapy
Diagnosis Certain
Diagnosis: Pleural calcification

Patient Data: 
Age - 50
Gender - Male

Patient Presentation: Chronic cough and left-sided chest pain for a long time.

Description: Left lower hemithorax dense irregular linear calcifications 
deep to the left lateral rib cage associated with tenting of the left 
diaphragm. 

Lungs are clear.

Case Discussion: The presence of a solitary, evident unilateral sheet of 
pleural calcification points more to local causes such as previous 
hemothorax and pleural infection (empyema) than to calcification of 
asbestos-related plaques.
